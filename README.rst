``ps`` and ``top`` for Human Beings
===================================

See below for `how to install`_.

Output
======

``ptop``
--------
|ptop screenshot|

* Note how the default sort order of CPU-usage-since-``ptop``-started makes the
  display mostly stable.
* Note the core count right next to the system load number, for easy comparison.
* Note the load history graph next to the load numbers. On this system the
  load went up during the last minute. This is a visualization of the numbers
  you get from ``uptime``.
* Note the ``IO Load`` number, this shows which IO device had the highest
  average throughput since ``ptop`` launched.
* Note that binaries launched while ``ptop`` is running are listed at the bottom
  of the display.
* Selecting a process with Enter will offer you to see detailed information
  about that process, in ``$PAGER``, `moar`_ or ``less``. Or to kill it.
* After you press ``q`` to quit, the display is retained and some lines at the
  bottom are removed to prevent the information you want from scrolling out of
  view.

``px``
-------------
Running just ``px`` lists all running processes, with the most interesting ones last.
Output truncated for brevity.

* To give you the most interesting processes close to your next prompt, ``px``
  puts last in its output processes that:

  * Have been started recently (can be seen in the list as high PIDs)

  * Are using lots of memory

  * Have used lots of CPU time

* Java processes are presented as their main class (``GradleDaemon``) rather
  than as their executable (``java``). `This support is available for many VMs`_.

``px java``

    Working directory too common, never mind.

  File descriptors:
    stdin : [PIPE] <not connected> (0x17d7619d3ae04819)

    stderr: [CHR] /dev/null

  Network connections:
    [IPv6] *:56789 (LISTEN)
    [IPv6] *:62498 (LISTEN)

  Inter Process Communication:
    mDNSResponder(201): [unix] ->0xe32cbd7be6021f1f

  For a list of all open files, do "sudo lsof -p 80727", or "sudo watch lsof -p 80727" for a live view.

* The command line has been split with one argument per line. This makes long
  command lines readable.
* The process tree shows how the Gradle Daemon relates to other processes.
* Details on how long ago Gradle Daemon was started, and how much CPU it has been
  using since.
* A list of other processes started around the same time as Gradle Daemon.
* A section describing where the standard file descriptors of the process go.
* A list of users logged in when the Gradle Daemon was started.
* A list of other processes with the same working directory as this one.
* A list of network connections the process has open.
* The IPC section shows that the Gradle Daemon is talking to ``mDNSResponder``
  using `Unix domain sockets`_.

The IPC data comes from ``lsof``. ``sudo`` helps ``lsof`` get more detailed
information; the command will work without it but might miss some information.

Killing processes
-----------------
If you want an interactive process killer using ``px`` and `fzf`_, you can make
a shell alias out of this:

::

  px --sort=cpupercent | fzf --bind 'ctrl-r:reload(px --sort=cpupercent)' --height=20 --no-hscroll --tac --no-sort --header-lines=1 | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kill -9

Type for fuzzy process search, use arrow keys to pick a process, Enter to kill,
CTRL-R to refresh the process list.

You can also add process previews by adding ``--preview='px {1}'`` to the
``fzf`` invocation, see if you like it!

Installation
------------
On `Debian 10 Buster`_ or later, and on `Ubuntu 19.04 Disco`_ and later, install using::

  sudo apt-get install px

If you have `Homebrew`_ on your system (likely on macOS)::

  brew install px

On other systems, install into ``/usr/local/bin`` by copy / pasting this command
into a terminal::

  curl -Ls https://github.com/walles/px/raw/python/install.sh | bash

Or you can install from Pypi. At least on macOS this can be problematic however,
so ``brew`` or the above install script is still preferred::

  sudo pip install --upgrade pxpx

After installing you should be able to run ``px``, ``px --help`` or ``ptop``
from the command line. Otherwise please verify that ``/usr/local/bin`` is in
your ``$PATH``.

To try ``px`` without installing it, just `download the latest px.pex`_,
``chmod a+x px.pex``, then run ``./px.pex``.

Usage
-----
Just type ``px`` or ``ptop``, that's a good start!

To exit ``ptop``, press "``q``".

Also try ``px --help`` to see what else ``px`` can do except for just listing all
processes.

If you run into problems, try running with the ``--debug`` switch, it will print
debug logging output after ``px``/``ptop`` is done.

Development
===========

Prerequisites
-------------

* A Python 2 version
* A Python 3.6+ version
* `tox`_

Building and Running
--------------------

Note that before editing any code, you need to run ``tox.sh`` once to create
the ``px/version.py`` file.

Note that the build infrastructure here is designed to create a ``px.pex`` file
that works on both Python 2 and Python 3, and on "all" machines with Python
interpreters (tested on Linux and macOS).

* Clone: ``git clone git@github.com:walles/px.git ; cd px``
* Build and test: ``./tox.sh``
* Run: ``./px.pex``
* To add dependencies, edit ``requirements.txt``

You can also run ``./devbin/tox-in-docker.sh``, which can be used to run Linux
tests on a Mac.

Releasing a new Version
-----------------------
To release a new version, run ``./devbin/release.sh`` and follow instructions.

Performance testing
-------------------
* Store the output of ``lsof -F fnaptd0i`` from a big system in lsof.txt.
* ``./devbin/benchmark_ipcmap.py lsof.txt``

Keeping this benchmark performant is important to be able to use ``px`` on big
systems.

To run it in a profiler, install `pyinstrument`_ and:

* ``python3 -m pyinstrument ./devbin/benchmark_ipcmap.py lsof.txt``

Or, to benchmark process listing:

* ``pyinstrument -r html ./devbin/benchmark_proc_get_all.py``

TODO ``top`` replacement
------------------------

* Disable terminal line wrapping for smoother handling of terminal window
  resizes.

TODO ``iotop`` replacement
--------------------------

* When given the ``--top`` flag and enough permissions, record per process IO
  usage and present that in one or more columns.

TODO misc
---------

* Details: When no users were found to be logged in at process start,
  automatically detect whether it's because we don't have history that far back or
  whether it seems to be that nobody was actually logged in. Inform the user about
  the outcome.
* In the px / top views, in the process owner column, maybe print other non-root
  process owners of parent processes inside parentheses?
* Ignore -E switch on Python command lines


DONE
----
* Make ``px`` list all processes with PID, owner, memory usage (in % of available
  RAM), used CPU time, full command line
* Output should be in table format just like ``top`` or ``ps``.
* Output should be truncated at the rightmost column of the terminal window
* Output should be sorted by ``score``, with ``score`` being ``(used CPU time) *
  (memory usage)``. The intention here is to put the most interesting processes on
  top.
* Each column should be wide enough to fit its widest value
* Add a section about installation instructions to this document.
* Add making-a-release instructions to this document
* Add a ``.travis.yml`` config to the project that:

  * OK: Runs ``flake8`` on the code
  * OK: Tests the code on OS X
  * OK: Tests the code on Linux

* When piping to some other command, don't truncate lines to terminal width
* If we get one command line argument, only show processes matching that string
  as either a user or the name of an executable.
* If we get something looking like a PID as a command line argument, show that
  PID process in a tree with all parents up to the top and all children down. This
  would replace ``pstree``.
* If we get something looking like a PID as a command line argument, for that
  PID show:

  * A list of all open files, pipes and sockets
  * For each pipe / domain socket, print the process at the other end
  * For each socket, print where it's going

* Doing ``px --version`` prints a ``git describe`` version string.
* Add a column with the name of each running process
* Put column headings at the top of each column
* In the details view, list processes as ``Name(PID)`` rather than ``PID:Name``.
  To humans the name is more important than the PID, so it should be first.
* In the details view, list a number of processes that were created around the
  same time as the one we're currently looking at.
* Implement support for ``px --top``
* If the user launches ``px`` through a symlink that's called something ending in
  ``top``, enter ``top`` mode.
* top: On pressing "q" to exit, redraw the screen one last time with a few less
  rows than usual before exiting.
* top: Print system load before the process listing.
* Parse Java and Python command lines and print the name of the program being
  executed rather than the VM.
* In the details view, list users that were logged in when the process was
  started.
* In the details tree view, print process owners for each line
* Print ``$SUDO_USER`` value with process details, if set
* Run CI on both Python 2 and Python 3
* In the details report, if the current process has a working directory that
  isn't ``/``, list all other processes that have the same working directory.
* ptop: Load bar: Set foreground color in green section to black, white on
  green is hard to read.
* ptop: Let user switch between CPU time sort and memory sort
