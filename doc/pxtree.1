.Dt PXTREE 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pxtree
.Nd display running processes in a tree
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.\" FIXME: Other man pages don't need to use \p to break lines here,
.\" and use the Nm macro for the command name. Why can't we?
.Ic pxtree [ --debug ] [ SEARCH ]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
lists all running processes in a tree.
.Pp
Process names are followed by their PIDs in parentheses. If multiple processes
have the same names, they will be coalesced into one entry marked with (3Ã—) in
bold, where
.Sy 3
in this case is the number of duplicates.
.Pp
The optional
.Cm SEARCH
parameter can be:
.Bl -bullet
.It
A PID (Process ID)
.It
A process name or part of one
.It
A user name
.El
.Pp
Any search hits will be highlighted in bold. All parents and children of all
search hits will always be listed.
.Pp
With the
.Fl -debug
flag, extra log messages are sometimes printed after
.Nm
finishes.
.Sh PROCESS NAMING
.Nm
tries to be helpful about naming processes, and avoid printing names
of various VMs.
.Pp
For example, if you do
.Sy java -jar foo.jar ,
.Nm
will show this process as
.Sy foo.jar
rather than
.Sy java .
.El
